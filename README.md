## Repository contains notebook that creates a data frame with differently encoded missing values in different columns. This data frame is written to a csv file and then reread back in. After the data is reread back in, the missing values are imputed. 

<b>Included file</b> 
* handling_missing_values.ipynb 

<b>Note: Running all cells in the notebook will generate vertical_jumps.csv, which will in turn be re-read back and the missing values in each column each handled separately. </b> 

<b>Note also: an html output file is NOT included since the data is randomly generated. </b>
